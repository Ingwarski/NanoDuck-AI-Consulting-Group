# Model preservation record

14 September 2026. This is a model-preservation record and content-free capability evidence, not a saved-settings export or live deployment configuration.

## Current local capability read

On 14 September 2026, this checkout's controlled Codex app-server preflight read the current account/catalog/rate-limit state without starting a model turn, creating a conversation, contacting MySQL or changing GoDaddy. It returned `ready` and listed `gpt-6-astra` with both `xhigh` and `ultra` reasoning efforts. The [U-01 capability matrix](../forge/runs/U-01/phase3-local-preflight-20260914/capability-matrix.json) records the content-free result.

This confirms that the current Codex catalog supports the current tuples. It does not independently prove a model invocation at either effort or record actual rate-limit quantities.

## Current saved settings

On 14 September 2026, an authenticated owner session viewed the named current GoDaddy app's Settings screen without changing a value, opening a secret, exporting content or calling a model. Its saved active Codex fields were:

| Field | Current saved value |
|---|---|
| Head/specialist provider | `codex` |
| Head/specialist model | `gpt-6-astra` |
| Head/specialist reasoning | `xhigh` |
| Critic provider | `codex` |
| Critic model | `gpt-6-astra` |
| Critic reasoning | `xhigh` |

The settings UI labelled the selectable catalog entries unavailable because its catalog snapshot was stale, but the saved raw provider/model/effort values above were present and exact. The inactive Claude branch was not selected or exposed as a saved current value, so it remained unknown in that dated observation.

## Owner-directed Critic setting — 22 September 2026

The owner supplied a current Claude picker screenshot and directed the Critic to use **Claude Code**, **Opus 5.5** (`claude-opus-5-5`) and **Medium** effort. Head and specialists remain on Codex `gpt-6-astra` / `xhigh`. The screenshot shows the effort choices Low, Medium (default), High, Extra and Max.

The repository applies this as a one-time saved-preference revision for future consultations. It preserves specialist count, discussion depth, sound and the Codex branch, and it never rewrites an accepted consultation snapshot. A later owner save is authoritative and is not overwritten on restart. This repository change does not prove a managed Claude grant, Opus 5.5 entitlement, a successful model turn or deployment.

## Selection and execution rules

Do not silently substitute a model or effort from an unavailable catalog or from a historical record. Fresh and pre-revision saved preferences move once to the owner-directed Opus 5.5 / Medium Critic tuple. The obsolete revision-2 `Claude Code default`, `default`, and `xhigh` placeholders and the former Opus 5 preference normalize to the current tuple. Later supported owner choices remain unchanged.

The current source pins `@openai/codex` to `0.153.1` and `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to `2.1.258`. Codex exposes only its live inspected catalog. The 22 September screenshot is the source for the current Claude Code Settings vocabulary: model **Opus 5.5** (`claude-opus-5-5`) and effort choices **Low**, **Medium** (the default), **High**, **Extra**, and **Max**. The app exposes that model plus any owner-configured candidate IDs only after its content-free managed-authentication check. It does not expose a fictitious “Claude Code default” model or unsupported `default`/`xhigh` effort values. At the isolated Claude CLI boundary, `claude-opus-5-5` maps to the installed CLI's documented moving `opus` alias, Medium passes through unchanged, and visible Extra maps to `xhigh`. A legacy `claude-opus-5` snapshot retains its exact model ID at that boundary instead of silently following the newer alias; an unsupported legacy ID fails visibly. Snapshots, Settings and exported records retain their owner-facing vocabulary. The rejected initial prototype offered only the historical Astra example. The three revision-2 candidates demonstrate selection using a copied, read-only local desktop Codex `model/list` catalog observed on 13 September: see [catalog evidence](../forge/design/evidence/local-model-catalog-20260913.json). This is local discovery evidence, not proof of the deployed app catalog or execution entitlement. Production must continue to inspect the selected provider before accepting a model/effort combination.

Preserve independent consultant settings and Critic provider/branch settings, specialist count, discussion depth, and immutable effective settings for a running consultation. Changing preferences affects future runs. Keep the no-API-key/PAYG/automatic-credit/Claude-Fast-Mode rule.

NanoDuck uses two independent controls: specialist count 1/2/3/5/Auto and discussion depth 1/3/5/Auto. Head selects an Auto team from one through five. Depth applies to every selected specialist; Auto assesses a complete team review and stops at supported consensus or 10 complete Critic ↔ specialist exchanges per specialist. The application defaults to 2 specialists and 1 exchange per specialist, while preserving the 540,000 ms provider budget. The 16 September correction explicitly rules out ending after Critic has reviewed only one team member.

Before cutover, verify each exact active `(provider, model, effort)` separately without private conversation content. The existing Astra entitlement probe at xhigh supports catalog compatibility but is not an invocation proof. If an exact selection cannot run, preserve it, report the limitation and obtain a decision; never substitute a model/effort just to pass readiness.
